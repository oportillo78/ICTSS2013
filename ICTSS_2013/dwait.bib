@inproceedings{ex1,
abstract = {Coping with software defects that occur in the post-deployment stage is a challenging problem: bugs may occur only when the system uses a specific configuration and only under cer- tain usage scenarios. Nevertheless, halting production sys- tems until the bug is tracked and fixed is often impossible. Thus, developers have to try to reproduce the bug in labora- tory conditions. Often the reproduction of the bug consists of the lion share of the debugging effort. In this paper we suggest an approach to address the afore- mentioned problem by using a specialized runtime environ- ment (QVM, for Quality Virtual Machine). QVM efficiently detects defects by continuously monitoring the execution of the application in a production setting. QVM enables the ef- ficient checking of violations of user-specified correctness properties, e.g., typestate safety properties, Java assertions, and heap properties pertaining to ownership. QVM is markedly different from existing techniques for continuous monitoring by using a novel overhead manager which enforces a user-specified overhead budget for quality checks. Existing tools for error detection in the field usually disrupt the operation of the deployed system. QVM, on the other hand, provides a balanced trade off between the cost of the monitoring process and the maintenance of sufficient accuracy for detecting defects. Specifically, the overhead cost of usingQVMinstead of a standard JVM, is lowenough to be acceptable in production environments. We implemented QVM on top of IBMâ€™s J9 Java Virtual Machine and used it to detect and fix various errors in real- world applications.},

abstract = {This paper shows that Appel-style garbage collectors often make suboptimal decisions both in terms of when and how to collect. We argue that garbage collection should be done when the amount of live bytes is low (in order to minimize the collection cost) and when the amount of dead objects is high (in order to maximize the available heap size after collection). In addition, we observe that Appel-style col- lectors sometimes trigger a nursery collection in cases where a full-heap collection would have been better. Based on these observations, we propose garbage collection hints (GCH) which is a profile-directed method for guiding garbage collec- tion. Offline profiling is used to identify favorable collection points in the program code. In those favorable collection points, the VM dynamically chooses between nursery and full-heap collections based on an analytical garbage collector cost-benefit model. By doing so, GCH guides the col- lector in terms of when and how to collect. Experimental results using the SPECjvm98 benchmarks and two generational garbage collectors show that substantial reductions can be obtained in garbage collection time (up to 30X) and that the overall execution time can be reduced by more than 10\%.},

abstract = {â€”In this paper, we define and study a new class of capacity planning models called MAP queueing networks. MAP queueing networks provide the first analytical methodology to describe and predict accurately the performance of complex systems operating under bursty workloads, such as multi-tier architectures or storage arrays. Burstiness is a feature that signif- icantly degrades system performance and that cannot be captured explicitly by existing capacity planning models. MAP queueing networks address this limitation by describing computer systems as closed networks of servers whose service times are Markovian Arrival Processes (MAPs), a class of Markov-modulated point processes that can model general distributions and burstiness. In this paper, we show thatMAP queueing networks provide reliable performance predictions even if the service processes are bursty. We propose a methodology to solve MAP queueing networks by two state space transformations, which we call Linear Reduc- tion (LR) and Quadratic Reduction (QR). These transformations dramatically decrease the number of states in the underlying Markov chain of the queueing network model. From these reduced state spaces, we obtain two classes of bounds on arbitrary performance indexes, e.g., throughput, response time, utilizations. Numerical experiments show that LR an QR bounds achieve good accuracy. We also illustrate the high effectiveness of the LR and QR bounds in the performance analysis of a real multi-tier architecture subject to TPC-W workloads that are characterized as bursty. These results promote MAP queueing networks as a new robust class of capacity planning models.},

abstract = {Garbage collection in the Java virtual machine is a core function that relieves application programmers of difficulties related to memory management. In this paper, we evaluate the performance of GenGC and GenRGC, garbage collectors for the embedded Java virtual machine, CVM. To compare the performance of GenGC and GenRGC, we first evaluate the execution time of garbage collection and the delay time caused by garbage collection. Second, for more detailed performance analysis of GenRGC, we evaluate the execution time of garbage collection and the delay time caused by garbage collection while changing the sizes of a block and a frame. Third, we analyze the size of storage space required for performing GenRGC, and show GenRGC to be suitable for embedded environment with a limited amount of memory. Since CVM is the most representative one of embedded Java virtual machines, this performance study is quite meaningful in that we can predict the performance of garbage collectors in real application environments more accurately.},

abstract = {The newly emergent cloud computing environments host hundreds to thousands of services on a shared resource pool. The sharing is enhanced by virtualization technologies allowing multiple services to run in different virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical node. Resource overbooking allows more services with time-varying demands to be consolidated reducing operational costs. In the past, researchers have studied dynamic control mechanisms for allocating CPU to virtual machines, when CPU is overbooked with respect to the sum of the peak demands from all the VMs. However, runtime re-allocation of memory among multiple VMs has not been widely studied, except on VMware platforms. In this paper, we present a case study where feedback control is used for dynamic memory allocation to Xen virtual machines in a consolidated environment. We illustrate how memory behaves differently from CPU in terms of its relationship to application-level performance, such as response times. We have built a prototype of a joint resource control system for allocating both CPU and memory resources to co-located VMs in real time. Experimental results show that our solution allows all the hosted applications to achieve the desired performance in spite of their time-varying CPU and memory demands, whereas a solution without memory control incurs significant service level violations.},

abstract = {Garbage collection yields numerous software engineering benefits, but its quantitative impact on performance remains elusive. One can compare the cost of conservative garbage collection to explicit memory management in C/C++ programs by linking in an appro- priate collector. This kind of direct comparison is not possible for languages designed for garbage collection (e.g., Java), because pro- grams in these languages naturally do not contain calls to free. Thus, the actual gap between the time and space performance of explicit memory management and precise, copying garbage collec- tion remains unknown. We introduce a novel experimental methodology that lets us quan- tify the performance of precise garbage collection versus explicit memory management. Our system allows us to treat unaltered Java programs as if they used explicit memory management by relying on oracles to insert calls to free. These oracles are generated from profile information gathered in earlier application runs. By executing inside an architecturally-detailed simulator, this â€œoracu- larâ€� memory manager eliminates the effects of consulting an oracle while measuring the costs of calling malloc and free. We eval- uate two different oracles: a liveness-based oracle that aggressively frees objects immediately after their last use, and a reachability- based oracle that conservatively frees objects just after they are last reachable. These oracles span the range of possible placement of explicit deallocation calls. We compare explicit memory management to both copying and non-copying garbage collectors across a range of benchmarks us- ing the oracular memory manager, and present real (non-simulated) runs that lend further validity to our results. These results quantify the time-space tradeoff of garbage collection: with five times as much memory, an Appel-style generational collector with a non- copying mature space matches the performance of reachability- based explicit memory management. With only three times as much memory, the collector runs on average 17\% slower than explicit memory management. However, with only twice as much memory, garbage collection degrades performance by nearly 70\%. When physical memory is scarce, paging causes garbage collection to run an order of magnitude slower than explicit memory management.},

abstract = {Cloud computing has seen tremendous growth, particularly for commercial web applications. The on-demand, pay-as-you-go model creates a flexible and cost-effective means to access compute resources. For these reasons, the scientific computing community has shown increasing interest in exploring cloud computing. However, the underlying implementation and performance of clouds are very different from those at traditional supercomputing centers. It is therefore critical to evaluate the performance of HPC applications in today's cloud environments to understand the tradeoffs inherent in migrating to the cloud. This work represents the most comprehensive evaluation to date comparing conventional HPC platforms to Amazon EC2, using real applications representative of the workload at a typical supercomputing center. Overall results indicate that EC2 is six times slower than a typical mid-range Linux cluster, and twenty times slower than a modern HPC system. The interconnect on the EC2 cloud platform severely limits performance and causes significant variability.},

Businesses that lack insight into J2EE components and APIs lack the ability to manage some of e-businessâ€™s most vital performance assets, assets that, when performing poorly or not at all, can down whole distributed applications.

abstract = {Runtime performance evaluation is necessary for the continuous QoS (Quality of Service) management of Web service-based applications. The analysis is critical in service provisioning since it allows to detect QoS degradation and to identify its source. However, performance analysis in current applications is usually based on QoS reference values that are manually instrumented and pre-established independently from the execution context. It is inflexible to change. The paper extends our previous research on performance evaluation within a self-healing framework and proposes a novel analysis approach based on automatic generation of QoS reference values. These QoS reference values are generated whenever we start the application execution in a new context. This approach enables the detection of QoS degradation, the identification of its nature (like execution or communication level) and the localization of its cause (as scalability issue, node failure or network overload). The carried out experiments show that the dynamic generated QoS reference values are suitable and their associated analysis results are accurate.},

The paper also discusses how the methods of capacity planning are impacted by the advent of cloud computing from the point of view of the cloud user and from the cloud provider.},

abstract = {In this work, we propose a new approach based on an application signature that enables a quick performance comparison of the new application signature against the old one, while the application continues its execution in the production environment. The application signature is built based on new concepts that are introduced here, namely the transaction latency profiles and transaction signatures. These become instrumental for creating an application signature that accurately reflects important performance characteristics. We show that such an application signature is representative and stable under different workload characteristics. We also show that application signatures are robust as they effectively capture changes in transaction times that result from software updates. Application signatures provide a simple and powerful solution that can further be used for efficient capacity planning, anomaly detection, and provisioning of multi-tier applications in rapidly evolving IT environments.},

abstract = {Cloud computing potentially solves some of the major challenges in the engineering of large software systems. With the promise of infinite capacity coupled with the ability to scale at the same speed as the traffic changes, it may appear that performance engineering will become redundant. Organizations might believe that there is no need to plan for the future, to optimize applications, or to worry about efficient operation. This paper argues that cloud computing is an area where performance engineering must be applied and customized. It will not be possible to â€œcloud washâ€� performance engineering by just applying previous methods. Rather it is essential to both understand the differences between the cloud and previous systems, and the applicability of proposed performance engineering methods.},

abstract = {For many performance analysis problems, the ability to rea- son across traces is invaluable. However, due to non-deter- minism in the OS and virtual machines, even two identical runs of an application yield slightly different traces. For example, it is unlikely that two identical runs of an applica- tion will suffer context switches at exactly the same points. These sorts of variations across traces make it difficult to reason across traces. This paper describes and evaluates an algorithm, Dynamic Time Warping (DTW), that can be used to align traces, thus enabling us to reason across traces. While DTWcomes from prior work our use ofDTWis novel. Also we describe and evaluate an enhancement toDTWthat significantly improves the quality of its alignments. Our results show that for applications whose performance varies significantly over time, DTWdoes a great job at align- ing the traces. For applications whose performance stays largely constant for significant periods of time, the original DTW does not perform well; however, our enhanced DTW performs much better.},

abstract = {Event-based communication is used in different domains including telecommunications, transportation, and busi- ness information systems to build scalable distributed systems. The loose coupling of components in such systems makes it easy to vary the deployment. At the same time, the complexity to estimate the behavior and performance of the whole system is increased, which complicates capacity planning. In this paper, we present an automated performance prediction method supporting capacity planning for event-based systems. The performance prediction is based on an extended version of the Palladio Component Model â€“ a performance meta-model for component- based systems. We apply this method on a real-world case study of a traffic monitoring system. In addition to the application of our performance prediction techniques for capacity planning, we evaluate the prediction results against measurements in the context of the case study. The results demonstrate the practicality and effectiveness of the proposed approach.},

abstract = {Bugs in software are costly and difficult to find and fix. In recent years, many tools and techniques have been developed for automatically finding bugs by analyzing source code or intermediate code statically (at compile time). Different tools and techniques have different tradeoffs, but the practical impact of these tradeoffs is not well understood. In this paper, we apply five bug finding tools, specifically Bandera, ESC/Java 2, FindBugs, JLint, and PMD, to a variety of Java programs. By using a variety of tools, we are able to cross-check their bug reports and warnings. Our experimental results show that none of the tools strictly subsumes another, and indeed the tools often find non-overlapping bugs. We discuss the techniques each of the tools is based on, and we suggest how particular techniques affect the output of the tools. Finally, we propose a meta-tool that combines the output of the tools together, looking for particular lines of code, methods, and classes that many tools warn about.},

abstract = {Publish/subscribe systems are used increasingly often as a communication mechanism in loosely-coupled distributed applications. With their gradual adoption in mission critical areas, it is essential that systems are subjected to a rigorous performance analysis before they are put into production. However, existing approaches to performance modeling and analysis of publish/subscribe systems suffer from many lim- itations that seriously constrain their practical applicability. In this paper, we present a set of generalized and comprehen- sive analytical models of publish/subscribe systems employ- ing different peer-to-peer and hierarchical routing schemes. The proposed analytical models address the major limita- tions underlying existing work in this area and are the first to consider all major performance-relevant system metrics including the expected broker and link utilization, the ex- pected notification delay, the expected time required for new subscriptions to become fully active, as well as the expected routing table sizes and message rates. To illustrate our ap- proach and demonstrate its effectiveness and practicality, we present a case study showing how our models can be ex- ploited for capacity planning and performance prediction in a realistic scenario.},

@article{Tong2010,
abstract = {Copying-based garbage collectors are currently widely employed in JVM systems, as they provide not only cheap allocations but also fast collections. Comparing to their compacting-based coun- terparts, copying-based collectors trade space for time: they con- servatively reserve half of the available heap for the purpose of copying live objects.1 It is a common belief, however, that ob- jectsâ€™ survival rates are generally too low to make full use of the reserved memory. We find through experiments that the total live object sizes of Java programs are generally small and remain rela- tively stable over many collections, which provides a perfect oppor- tunity for optimization.We analyze this phenomenon and propose a â€œskew-spaceâ€�2 collector that would reserve spaces of dynamically adjusted sizes coming from online predictions. The proposed col- lector has been realized using MMTk in the JikesRVM, and has shown promising improvements in the total execution time for the SPECjvm98 and DaCapo benchmarks.},

abstract = {Currently, the most adopted criterion to invoke garbage collection is heap space exhaustion. In other words, garbage collection is invoked when the heap space (either the entire space or generational space) runs out. A possible alternative but much more difficult approach is to invoke garbage collection when good garbage collection efficiencies can be obtained. To do so, we need to know number of garbage objects that can be collected before the collection actually takes place. In this short abstract, we introduce a predictive approach that can provide an accurate estimation of the number of dead objects at any specific point of execution. The proposed estimation model relies on the information obtained from partial reference counting. Our plan is to use this information as a criterion to invoke garbage collection. We have conducted a preliminary study to determine the feasibility of this idea and found that the model is sufficiently accurate in three SPECjvm98 benchmark applications.},

As more time is spent on garbage collection, less time is spent on executing the application; thus, the throughput performance degrades drastically. As a result, we conclude that garbage collection is a major factor that can affect the throughput and degradation behavior of the Java application server.},

abstract = {Generally believed to be a problem belonging to the compiler and architecture communities, performance optimization has rarely gained attention in mainstream software engineering research. However, due to the proliferation of large-scale object-oriented software de- signed to solve increasingly complex problems, performance is- sues stand out, preventing applications from meeting their perfor- mance requirements. Many such issues result from design princi- ples adopted widely in the software research community, such as the idea of software reuse and design patterns. We argue that, in the modern era whenMooreâ€™s dividend becomes less obvious, per- formance optimization is more of a software engineering problem than ever and should receive much more attention in the future. We explain why this is the case, review what has been achieved in soft- ware bloat analysis, present challenges, and provide a road map for future work.},
